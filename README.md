# Tower-Research Data Challenge
TRC Data Challenge | IIT Bombay

This repository contains the code and related materials for my participation in the quantitative competition hosted by Tower Research Capital at IIT Bombay. The competition aimed to showcase innovative strategies and techniques for financial forecasting and trading using quantitative methods.

Within this repo, you can find the codebase that I developed for the competition, including scripts, notebooks, and data preprocessing and visualization tools.

Participating in this competition has provided me with valuable experience in exploring the field of data science from the perspective of a quantitative researcher.
